NAME
  ripencgame - rips and encodes audio tracks from a game CD as OGG
SYNOPSIS
  ripencgame [discnumber]
DESCRIPTION
  ripencgame rips the currently-inserted game CD (e.g. tracks 2+), 
  then encodes as a 
  series of .ogg files. If discnumber is provided, it is used to format
  the result filename. Ripping is performed by the cdparanoia(1) tool,
  renamed by rename(1), then encoded by oggenc(1).
  
  The filename format will be recognized by the loadtags(1) utility,
  which can be used to load metadata after the operation completes.
SEE ALSO
