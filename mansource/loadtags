NAME
  loadtags - loads tags into freshly-ripped audio files
SYNOPSIS
  loadtags
DESCRIPTION
  loadtags will update the tags for all ogg/flac files in the current
  directory based on a pair of template files: template.txt and 
  tracks.txt, which must exist in the same folder. All filenames
  are expected to conform to the conventions of the rip* utilities
  (e.g. ripencflac(1)). Track and disc numbers will be extracted from
  the filename if it matches this convention.
  
  template.txt contains all desired tags to be included in every file
  in the current folder. This will typically contain album name, artist
  and the like. The following is an example file:
  
	Album=Xenoblade OST
	Artist=Yoko Shimomura, ACE+, Manami Kiyota, Yasunori Mitsuda
	Genre=Game Soundtrack
	COMPOSER=Yoko Shimomura, ACE+, Manami Kiyota, Yasunori Mitsuda
	DATE=2010

  tracks.txt contains a listing of all track names, with each subsequent
  track (even across multiple discs) on its own line. The following a 
  subset of the same example:
  
	Main Theme
	Prologue A
	Prologue B
	Daily Life
	Memories
	Thoughts to a Friend
	Monado Reacts
	Crisis
	Confrontation with the Enemy
	Sorrow
