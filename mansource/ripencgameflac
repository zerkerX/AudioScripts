NAME
  ripencgameflac - rips and encodes audio tracks from a game CD as FLAC
SYNOPSIS
  ripencgameflac [discnumber]
DESCRIPTION
  ripencgameflac rips the currently-inserted game CD (e.g. tracks 2+), 
  then encodes as a 
  series of .flac files. If discnumber is provided, it is used to format
  the result filename. Ripping is performed by the cdparanoia(1) too,
  renamed by rename(1), then encoded by flac(1).
  
  The filename format will be recognized by the loadtags(1) utility,
  which can be used to load metadata after the operation completes.
SEE ALSO
  cdparanoia(1), rename(1), flac(1), loadtags(1)
