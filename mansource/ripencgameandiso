NAME
  ripencgameandiso - rips game audio as OGG and rips track 1 as ISO
SYNOPSIS
  ripencgameandiso [discnumber]
DESCRIPTION
  ripencgameandiso rips the currently-inserted game CD (e.g. tracks 2+), 
  then encodes as a series of .ogg files. Also rips track 1 as an ISO 
  file. If discnumber is provided, it is used to format
  the result filename. Ripping is performed by the cdparanoia(1) 
  and dd(1) tools,
  renamed by rename(1), then encoded by oggenc(1).
  
  The filename format will be recognized by the loadtags(1) utility,
  which can be used to load metadata after the operation completes.
