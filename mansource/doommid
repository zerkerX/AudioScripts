NAME
  doommid - Plays a Doom midi file
SYNOPSIS
  doommid [file]...
DESCRIPTION
  doommid is a tool designed to be specified as the midi playback device
  for chocolate doom.
  doommid plays the specified midi file using pmidi(1), using the amidi(1)
  tool to first reset the midi device, and killall(1) to terminate any
  existing midi playback. These are required to work around quirky
  midi playback issues with Chocolate Doom.
  
  Presently, the midi device is hardcoded inside the script.
SEE ALSO
  pmidi(1), amidi(1), killall(1)
